    <h1>Bánh Cuốn (Vietnamese Steamed Rice Rolls)</h1>
    <p><strong>Bánh cuốn</strong>, also known as <em>Vietnamese Steamed Rice Rolls</em>, is a dish 
        that I have been enjoying since I was a little kid. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Though I am <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> 
        a big connoisseur of Vietnamese food, this is the dish that always 
        makes me feel at home! It brings me memories of my mom masterfully pouring
        out the batter to make thin rice "crepes" to be filled with delicious
        filling.  
    </p>    
    
    <p>Look at that delciousness below! When it is garnished with
        crispy fried shallots, sliced cucumbers, blanched bean sprouts, 
        Vietnamese herbs, and slices of <i>chả lụa</i>, all you need is a small bowl 
        of <i>nước mắm chấm</i> and you are ready to enjoy!
    </p>
